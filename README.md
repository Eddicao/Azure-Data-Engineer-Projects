# Data Engineer Projects using Azure tools

## Overview

This repo is created with the aim of acumulating gradually & continously valuable knowledge in the field Data Engineer.
Currently, I am focusing on Azure data platform with Data Factory, Databricks & Synapse Analytics...
I'm also learning & practicing more with Airflow running on Docker and using Git/GitHub daily.
